bot-core
========

A minimal bot core written in Groovy

On it's own, this doesn't really do a right lot. You'll need to build in ops
and services to make the bot useful. I'll add some docs on how to do this
later.... maybe

Running
-------

To run a bot:

`$ ./bot`

Configuring
-----------
To configure the bot, edit etc/bot.conf with your favourite text editor.
