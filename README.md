bot-core
========

A minimal bot core written in Groovy

On it's own, this doesn't really do a right lot. You'll need to build in ops
and services to make the bot useful. I'll add some docs on how to do this
later.... maybe

Building
--------

To build the bot core, use gradle:

`$ gradle build`

Running
-------

To run a bot:

`$ bot`
