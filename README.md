gart-core
=========

A minimal async runtime written in Groovy

On it's own, this doesn't really do much. You'll need to build in ops
and services to make gart useful. I'll add docs on how to do this
later.... maybe

Pre-reqs
--------
Download and install Groovy (2+) and Java (7+). Set the GROOVY_HOME and
JAVA_HOME env vars to the location of their install directories.

Running
-------
To run gart:

`$ ./gart`
