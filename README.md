bot-core
========

A minimal bot core written in Groovy

On it's own, this doesn't really do much. You'll need to build in ops
and services to make a bot useful. I'll add docs on how to do this
later.... maybe

Pre-reqs
--------
Download and install Groovy (2+) and Java (7+). Set the GROOVY_HOME and
JAVA_HOME env vars to the location of their install directories.

Running
-------
To run a bot:

`$ ./bot`

Configuring
-----------
To configure the bot, edit etc/bot.conf with your favourite text editor.
