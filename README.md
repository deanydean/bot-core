bot-core
========

A minimal bot core written in Groovy

On it's own, this doesn't really do a right lot. You'll need to build in ops
and services to make the bot useful. I'll add some docs on how to do this
later.... maybe

Configuring
-----------
To configure the bot:

`$ cp bot.conf.template bot.conf`

And then edit bot.conf with your favourite text editor.

Running
-------

To run a bot:

`$ ./bot`

To get all bot dependencies (gradle required) use:

`$ ./bot get deps`
